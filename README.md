# Learning Golang

This repo is an extension of the golang article about building web applications found [here][]. I changed it to use Postgres instead of text files and for the wiki pages to use markdown syntax.

The current name of the project is **WikiWAT**, but it will probably change once I learn what I'm doing.

If you want to install this on your own machine, just run:

    go get github.com/pdebelak/golang-learning
